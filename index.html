  	       <p>
  	     	    We aim to offer a simple and innovative way to communicate with loved ones. It is not always easy to catch up for lack of time... The Daily Family app allows you to share a little moment of your life every day. You can share photos, videos, audio, text or favorites like the book you just finished or the music you discovered two minutes ago. You are free to share what you want, in all forms. 
             We are in a way the intermediary between your life and that of those you love.

  	       <h2>3. History</h2>
          <p>
            I decided to create this application to allow everyone to stay in touch with their family despite the distance, the everyday life that can, be quite busy. I have always tried to check on my family but it is sometimes difficult to do so on a daily basis. Since, I had the idea to set up a platform that would allow us to share a new aspect of our lives: everyday activities.
